# SimpleDashboard
Multiple KPIs and one chart

The Data is not connected to the chart, but have generated  some values just for the look and feel. Please feel free to play around with this.

I will commit with better features in the months to come.

Made using VSCode. Just download it and open them in a workspace. It should work.
